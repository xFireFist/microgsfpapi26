(WIP) MicroG Services Framework Proxy fork with target api bumped (23>26) for android 15 compatibility

Starting with Android 15 you are no longer (easily) able to install apps with target api 23 (android 6 marshmallow) or below, so i created this fork of MicroG Services Framework Proxy with target api 26 (android 8.0 oreo) instead for ease of use.
